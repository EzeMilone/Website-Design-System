# Website-Design-System

This project is a simple project from Codecademy's "Full-Stack Engineer" Carreer. 
The idea of the project is to give a closure to the "Improved Styling with CSS" section.

Project Goals:
In this project, you’ll be building your own basic design system for a website. 
In essence, you’ll be building a website to help you build MORE websites in the future! 
On your site, you’ll collect all the colors, fonts, and some of the repeating styles.
